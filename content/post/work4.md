After getting dumped by my high school girlfriend turned fiancé, I found myself at a strange place in life. I was 19, just a year out of high school and I had no direction or purpose to speak of. On a whim, I decided to try art but soon realized I could not draw or paint. 

I wondered into the locale camera store and walked out with a $1500 digital camera. I had no idea what I was going to do with it. I just knew I needed to fill a void in my life.

I only had the camera a few weeks when a friend of mine’s brother was going play a show at the now closed Juanita's on Main Street. I had never seen a locale band before and I had only really ever listened to music on the radio. I agreed to go thinking I could take photos.

The photo above was the first photo I took of the very first song the band played. It was at this exact moment I discovered photography and "The Scene." I knew from the second I looked down at the LCD screen and saw the image that this was what I was supposed to shoot and these were my people.
