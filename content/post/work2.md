The Mansion Family hails from Marshall Texas. You could say they are a both little bit country and little bit Rock 'n' Roll. Either way, they have a sound that can fill a room and get it dancing.

Members of the band are Chris Dean, Eric Gardner, Kasey Brown, John Fox, Nick Brumley, and Sam Kilpatrick. They are true their musical heritage with an upright bass holding down the rhythm section. They have guitars to spare, but everyone finds their sonic space.

Shooting this band always meant a lot to me. Chris Dean and I first met in 2007 when I went to work for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. I knew Chris's name long before I met him as I always studied all the photos in the paper, trying to learn all I could. When I went to work there, he took me in like Batman did Robin. He taught me how to shoot sports, crime scenes, and JÃ¤ger.
