Boom Kinetic is way more than a cover band. A Boom Kinetic set can last anywhere from two to four hours with no breaks in the music. Their song list contains any song a major artist has played in their encore set in the last 40 years. Its almost overwhelming! The energy in the room is like a roller coaster that never seems to come down. If you find yourself at Boom show by the end of the night you will be worn out from singing every word to every song and memorized by the perfectly synced up light show that rivals most arena bands.  I can't usually remember the after party but I never forget the show.
